# SyntaxHighlighter

SyntaxHighlighter is THE client side highlighter for the web and apps! It's been around since
2004 and it's used virtually everywhere to seamlessly highlight code for presentation.

# This is a clone of the original project

[v3.0.90 downloaded here](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter/syntaxhighlighter/releases)
I have changed to use gulp for building the project but have not provided a gulp task for the tests. The original gruntfiles are still present. 

# Building

1. Have node.js v0.10 or higher
1. From the source folder run `npm install`
1. Then `bower install` to download dependencies
1. Then `gulp` to build
1. Look in the `pkg` folder for results!
